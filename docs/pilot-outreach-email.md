## Body
Hi {{first_name}},

I am running a small pilot for engineering teams using AI coding assistants heavily.

We built **MergeGuard**, a verification layer that scores AI-assisted PRs and flags risky diffs (missing tests, brittle changes, high-risk files) before merge.

Pilot structure:
- Duration: 2 weeks
- Setup: GitHub app + baseline checks
- Success target: 20% faster review cycle or 15% fewer regressions

If useful, I can share a 20-minute walkthrough and a sample verification report.

Would {{day_option_1}} or {{day_option_2}} work?

Best,
{{sender_name}}
